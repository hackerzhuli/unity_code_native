# UXML SCHEMA
In a Unity Project, uxml schema is at the directory `UIElementsSchema` in project root. All schema files are directly in this directory, no sub directories. They define what VisualElement classes are there that can be used in uxml and also uss, also all their attributes for uxml. The extension is `.xsd`.
