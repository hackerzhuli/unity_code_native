TODO list:
- [x] Improve hover on for import statement in uss, because now it doesn't have any hover.
- [x] Improve hover for url path in uss, so that we show a clickable link for a file that does exist
- [x] Improve hover for property to include syntax and examples and better description to make the hover doc for property better, also as for property value that is keyword, we should also include what that keyword does, hover docs is the most efficient way for user to get what he needed, so it must be good
- [x] Add auto completion for properties and values
- [ ] Add support for tss files, also note that "theme://default" (or something like that) is actually valid url in tss import statement, it is a special case. Should not create an error for that.
- [ ] Let our uss file and tss file use the same icon as css file in vs code
- [x] Format document and format selection(both uss and tss).
- [x] Add auto completion to actual VisualElement types
- [x] Add url argument auto completion(in which case we should detect what is actually on the filesytem to help user type faster, also we should add query string to includ guid file id and such to make the url complete)(for query parameters, we may not be able to do it perfectly because in the case of sprites, we may not be able to show user the sprites inside of the file)
- [x] Add auto completion for @import when user just typed an @ , we assume they typing an import statement, and give user a basic structure complete with quotes and semicolon. Give completion items to show a relative path or a absolute path or with project scheme. If possible put cursor before closing quote so user can keep typing the path.
- [x] Add Auto completion for pseudo classes
- [ ] Make sure our hover will cover everything that needs some docs, including pseudo classes!
- [x] Add a warning for duplicate property in same block, that is probably a mistake
- [x] Add docs when auto completing pseudo classes
- [x] Verify property names(not custom variables) are case sensitive or not in uss and ajust our code accordingly
- [x] Add support for diagnostics for comma seperated values(eg. transitions), for now we just treat any property can be comma seperated, keep it simple. In the future we might be more specific.
- [x] Check our value spec against the format string and find problems with our value spec, make sure our value spec is solid
- [x] ~~`transform` seems to be a special property for `transition-property` because Unity doesn't actually have this property but allow to use it in `transition-property` value, is this true? we need to confirm.~~
- [ ] We need to have a complete list of keywords(not including color keywords), though some may not contain documentation.
- [ ] Add a simple refactor feature (ie. code action) that is renaming id selectors and class selectors in a document.
- [x] Property value auto completion: we should always provide auto completion for property value if a property can be a single value of keywords(unless it is a color property or other properties that have an dedicated completion logic), we only show the keywords.
- [x] Dedicated autocompletion for `transition-property`, completion with animatable properties.
- [x] For properties that supports multiple values, we should trigger completion after comma just like after colon, a new value, same completion logic.
- [ ] Bug: Auto completion for property names doesn't work if we are typing (at least one character) before another valid property in a block.
- [ ] We should make sure our list of color and their hex value are identical to what's shown in Unity's offcial docs, add a test for that.

TODO for consideration:
- [ ] (We should do this later, it is complex because it involves Unity Editor) Add code action for url when url does include a guid, but file doesn't exist or guid doesn't match, then we can offer a code action to fix it, typically it is because user moved a file, which involves messaging Unity Editor, because we need to locate the asset, which could fail due to non existence of the guid or Unity Editor is busy
- [ ] (Not needed now because it usually doesn't happen in practice)Add additional validation for url in uss that includes guid, if file path exists but guid (the query parater in url) doesn't match, show an warning, though this should be rare in practice
- [ ] Url auto completion should not show an item that is the file itself, importing/reference self makes no sence, and this can cause other problems
